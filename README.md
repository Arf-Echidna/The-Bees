# The-Bees
Do you like Jazz? 

Run the script. Enter the name of the window you'd like to type the Bee Movie into. 
Press start.  The window should be automatically selected, and the script will start typing. 

* The window is frozen while the script is typing because I'm bad at multithreading. 
Just close the background shell to kill it prematurely.
